#### Michael Nielsen - [Augmenting Long-Term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)
Nielsen argues for using a personal memory system to improve our ability to remember *things* long term. He walks through how he uses [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and how their "distributed practice" method works to allow for committing thing to long term memory. This is an issue that I've definitely faced, when I read a book or paper or article and take notes, only to wish that I could have a better system for finding the important information and recalling it rather than forgetting all but the few most applicable things after two weeks or so. I'm definitely going to give this "all purpose memory flashcard deck" thing a shot
