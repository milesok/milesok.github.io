#### Alex Chamberlain - "Where Vertical Approach Angle Seems to Matter Most" [Fangraphs] (https://blogs.fangraphs.com/where-vertical-approach-angle-seems-to-matter-most/)
The biggest takeaway I got from this is alternatives to the "just high spin fastballs up in the zone" camp. Hitters seem to not swing a lot *at all* at "flat" pitches at the bottom of the zone. The argument here is that we should look at both VAA and pitch height and the effects on both getting whiffs and takes to optimize a given pitcher's approach. It also made me realize that VAA isn't publicly available for Statcast data and that it might be useful to use our college Trackman data to model it for MLB data.

#### Nate Silver - "The Signal and the Noise"
Chapter 7, *Role Models*, discusses agent-based disease models and weather simulations - it seems like maybe the best ways to look at these complex nonlinear dynamical systems might be to try to mechanistically simulate from the ground up. I'm not sure what this would look like for baseball, but the growing amount of biomechanical data that is becoming available (at least privately) seems like it could be super helpful for allowing much more comprehensive models of the *process* of a play, not just large-scale trends and outcomes.
