# Hello Again

Welcome to 2021! I'm going to try and take another shot at publicly producing content this year.

Here's a rough outline of what I think I want this space to look like. It will definitely change based on me not actually having as much time as I think I will, but right now, in an ideal world, it'd look something like this:

### Research
Writing up my projects. Most of these will be baseball research related, but anything I do I'll try to document in at least some way here.

### Tutorials


### What I Already Know
#### First Principles
Inspired by Aristotle's (and many others after him) ideas of first principles thinking (explained [here](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)) 

### What I'm Learning
* **Feynman-inspired Crash Courses**: Any classes or online courses I take, I'm going to post my notes here. This is more for my own benefit than anything, for accountability so I can (1) find the weaknesses in my understanding and (2) record what I'm learning for whenever I might want to come back and review.

* **Book "Reviews"**
Not as much a "review" in the traditional sense, but write ups of what I'm learning from books I read, and how I think I can apply those lessons to what I'm interested in.

* **Research and Article "Reviews"**
Similar to the above but with a smaller scope and greater emphasis on the small questions being asked and ways to advance/expand on ideas.

The overall ideal for these three bullets is to work towards having a personal "Theory of Everything," connecting all the things I've learned to help inspire and form a foundation for future questions.



### Random Other Thoughts
A blog basically to get random thoughts out. No rules!
