This project is derived from a class project I completed last semester, and hopefully I will continue to expand on it to improve the model.





### Future Directions
- Expand this to injuries in general. Because these happen more often, maybe a better way to model injury risk is to look at all arm injuries and put them onto a severity scale.
- Look for other datasets that might be useful (e.g. reported injury history (scraped from MLB.com official reports, the internet, or inferring based off missed games or pitch counts)
- Compare these results to deep learning methods
