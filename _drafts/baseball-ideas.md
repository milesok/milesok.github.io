## Some Baseball Research Questions I'm Interested In

* Branching off Ethan Moore's [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/3-things-we-could-learn-from-swing-timing-analysis-84486fdab209) on swing timing analysis, what if we could analyze swing timing with computer vision and do a bigger analysis?

* Would a change in perspective for pitch design help? What kind of information does the batter take in visually and how does that compare to just the ground truth physics data that we normally measure?

* What kinds of information are we missing by treating pitches, plate appearances, etc. as independent events?

* What ways can we quanitfy "intangibles"?
