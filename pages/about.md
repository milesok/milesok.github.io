Welcome to my website!

My name is Miles, I'm from Dallas, Texas, and I'm currently a student at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm working on my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Biomechanics, and planning to graduate in Spring 2022.

Baseball is one of my biggest passions. I pitched in high school, but topped out around 84 mph, so I pivoted to pursuing a career on the nerd side of things. I'm currently a student intern for The University of Texas baseball team, and have been working there during my time as a student, doing all sorts of R&D stuff, from building visualizations and reports to improving tools for video and data management to running Trackman, Rapsodo, and video during games and practices. Head over to my [now page](/now) for an idea of what I'm working on currently.
